    <h1>Dameas</h1>

    <article>
        <h2>Introdution</h2>
        <p>Dameas is a personal wiki created by Billy Joe R. Santos inspired by Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks and Fabio Akita's YouTube channel. Its purpose is to compile all useful or non-useful knowledge I gather.</p>

        <p>The name wasn't chosen by any specific reason; The author was looking to transmit the idea of "knowledge" and any greek word for it, but the outcome was unsatisfactory, so "Dameas" was an interesting greek-sounding word. Later it was found that Dameas was a sculptor that worked on the statue of Milo of Croton in Olympia.</p> 

        <p>The author, despite knowing how to create visually appealing and well-organised web pages, preferred to follow the strategy of first accumulating all the content, then investing time on the style.</p>

        <p>Tools that could have improved the process of writing a blog were discarded for, even though they could simplify the work, all this would loose the rawness of old the internet DIY (Do It Yourself) spirit.</p>

        <p>Currently the contents that have pages are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <a href="./gardening/">
                    Gardening
                </a>
                <a href="./motorcycles/">
                    Motorcycles
                </a>
            </li>
        </ol>
