The internet is one of the greatest inventions of humanity, but for years I have been using only for entertainment purposes. Inspired by the habits of geniuses like Leonardo da Vinci of taking vital notes for everything, even minor habits, I've decided to use some of my programming knowledge to create a compilation of all the knowledge I've gathered and not waste it due to a feeble long-term memory.

Inspired by George Lucas' character presented in the 1989 movie "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade", Henry Jones, and  specifically by his diary, a man named Fabio Akita created his blog and YouTube channel [^1]. Despite looking like a simple habit from a man not much know outside his community, this inspired me highlighting that a lot of things we throw away, is useful knowledge.

The repository started simple, using mostly the good old HTML to structure the pages in the most article way as possible, but although keynotes and crucial information is presented in english, most pages will be in portuguese or even informal portuguese, for the purpose of these pages is to work like a mix between personal wiki, journal, and blog.

Hope you enjoy!
